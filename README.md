# WindGym-Zoo

This repository hosts the **official model zoo** for [WindGym](https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/sys/windgym): a reinforcement learning environment for wind farm control under sensor uncertainty and noisy flow conditions.

WindGym-Zoo includes:
- ðŸ“¦ Pretrained RL agents (e.g., PPO, SAC)
- ðŸ§Š Frozen environment configurations for reproducible evaluation
- ðŸ“ˆ Baseline metrics for leaderboard-style comparisons

This repository is designed to support nightly benchmarking pipelines and community-submitted agents.
